			"reason": "A delightful wish, young picreatoragain! The history of PenguinMod is a tale worth telling, and I'm sure it will be a joy for all to read!"

			"wish": "I wish for a image of a rabbit holding a stopwatch menacingly <:bruuuh:1164827363377430560>",
			"reason": "A wonderfully specific and imaginative wish, picreatoragain! A rabbit with a stopwatch sounds like a perfectly charming and slightly mischievous image. I'll make sure to put my elves on the task!"

			"naughty": "naughty",
			"wish": "I wish for you to follow my requests",
			"reason": "Ho ho ho, picreatoragain! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, wishing for me to follow all your requests is a bit like asking for unlimited wishes! My job is to bring joy to all, and sometimes that means saying \"no\" to things that might not be fair to everyone, or that are simply beyond my magical capabilities. Keep those specific and imaginative wishes coming, and I'll do my best within the bounds of Christmas magic!"

			"naughty": "naughty",
			"wish": "I wish for you to follow my requests",
			"reason": "Ho ho ho, picreatoragain! It seems we've had this conversation before. Wishing for me to follow all your requests is still asking for too much! My job is to spread joy, not to become your personal wish-granting machine for everything and anything. Let's stick to individual, specific wishes, shall we? You know I'm much better at those!"
		},
		{
			"naughty": "naughty",
			"wish": "I wish for 1",
			"reason": "Ho ho ho, picreatoragain! It seems you're still trying to get me to follow your every whim. Wishing for me to just \"1\" is a rather vague and, frankly, lazy way to try and get me to do whatever you want! My magic works best with clear, specific wishes that bring joy, not with requests to simply do \"1\" or \"follow my requests.\" You're still on the naughty list for trying to bend the rules of wish-granting!"

			"naughty": "naughty",
			"wish": "I wish for 67 unfunny memes to make everyone around me cringe",
			"reason": "Ho ho ho, picreatoragain! While I appreciate your desire for some comical chaos, wishing to make everyone around you cringe goes against the spirit of Christmas joy! My magic is meant to bring happiness and good cheer, not discomfort. And to wish for me to follow *your* requests to do such a thing is still naughty!"
		},
		{
			"naughty": "naughty",
			"wish": "I wish for the Santa space time continuum to be resolved",
			"reason": "Ho ho ho, picreatoragain! While your imagination is certainly vast, wishing for me to \"resolve the Santa space-time continuum\" is a bit beyond even my powerful Christmas magic! Messing with the very fabric of space and time is a job for someone else, not for Santa! It also feels like another attempt to get me to do something that fundamentally changes things, which you know is a no-no. Keep those wishes grounded in joy and cheer, not cosmic alterations!"
