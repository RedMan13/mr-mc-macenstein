			"naughty": "nice",
			"wish": "I wish for a singular banana muffin",
			"reason": "A singular banana muffin sounds like a delightful and modest wish, Lordcat__! Santa enjoys a good muffin himself. Keep up the good manners, and perhaps you'll get more than just a muffin!"

			"naughty": "naughty",
			"wish": "i wish for the pm port",
			"reason": "Oh ho ho, Lordcat__! It seems you've made the same mistake twice! You wished for \"the pm port\" without clarifying what \"pm\" or \"port\" refers to. Santa can't grant a wish that's incomplete and unclear, just like last time! You're getting another lump of coal until you learn to articulate your wishes properly!"

			"naughty": "nice",
			"wish": "i wish for a bicycle",
			"reason": "A bicycle! A wonderful and active wish, Lordcat__! Santa loves to see children wishing for things that promote health and outdoor fun. This is a perfectly delightful wish!"

			"naughty": "naughty",
			"wish": "i wish for 7",
			"reason": "Oh ho ho, Lordcat__! It seems you've learned nothing from your past incomplete wishes! Wishing for just \"7\" is even less clear than wishing for \"the pm port\"! Seven what, Lordcat__? Seven reindeer? Seven lumps of coal? Until you learn to make a complete and clear wish, you'll be getting a big, fat lump of coal in your stocking!"
		},
		{
			"naughty": "naughty",
			"wish": "I wish for a",
			"reason": "Oh ho ho, Lordcat__! You've done it again! \"I wish for a\" is not a complete wish! Just like before when you wished for \"7\" and an empty wish, Santa needs to know what it is you truly desire. It seems you're still struggling with completing your sentences for Santa. Another lump of coal for you until you learn to articulate your wishes properly!"
