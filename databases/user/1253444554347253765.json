Such a wish touches upon the very fabric of existence and the mysteries that even Santa does not meddle with. Let us focus on wishes that bring joy and light, shall we? This one, I'm afraid, lands squarely on the naughty list for its rather macabre nature."

			"reason": "Ho ho ho, lastoneimmakin! It seems you're still exploring the darker corners of wishing. \"Carnage,\" my dear, is a wish for chaos and destruction, much like your previous wish to \"see death.\" Santa prefers wishes that bring joy, peace, and perhaps a bit of delightful mischief, not wishes for widespread mayhem. You're staying on the naughty list for this one, I'm afraid!"
