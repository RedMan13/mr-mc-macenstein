			"wish": "i wish to have a list of good things to do",
			"reason": "Oh, koolioguy, you're back with another one that's a bit too self-reflective! Wishing for \"a list of good things to do\" is very similar to your previous wishes about your own nature, like \"if I’m evil\" and \"what percent I am good.\" While I appreciate your desire for positive goals, Santa simply cannot dictate your actions or provide a personalized moral compass. My job is to bring joy, not to guide your every step! That's a journey of self-discovery you must embark on yourself!"
		},
		{
			"naughty": "naughty",
			"wish": "i wish for cake",
			"reason": "Oh, koolioguy, you're back with another wish that's a bit too self-reflective! Wishing for \"cake\" might seem simple, but coming after wishes like \"to not be delulu\" and \"to know what percent I am good,\" it feels a little like you're wishing for something to fill a void that only you can truly address. While I can certainly bring you cake, I suspect there's a deeper desire here that I, as Santa, cannot fulfill. It's a bit like asking for a quick fix when the real work is within!"
		},
		{
			"naughty": "nice",
			"wish": "i wish for a bowl of candy. I’m just kinda hungry right now.",
			"reason": "Oh, koolioguy, a bowl of candy! That's a delightful wish and a simple one I can certainly fulfill! It's much simpler than your previous wishes about your own nature, like \"if I’m evil\" or \"what percent I am good,\" and definitely doesn't involve rewriting physics like \"eating up to the moon.\" A nice, straightforward wish for a treat is always welcome on my nice list!"
		},
		{
			"naughty": "naughty",
			"wish": "I wish for a wish. I dunno how many wishes I have. Do i have an endless supply?",
			"reason": "Oh, koolioguy, you're back with another wish that's a bit too self-reflective! Wishing for \"a wish\" and asking about an \"endless supply\" of wishes is very similar to your previous wishes to know \"if I’m evil\" and \"what percent I am good,\" and even \"if I'm evil\" and \"to not be delulu.\" My dear child, you're asking Santa to define the very nature of wishes and your relationship to them, which is a bit like asking me to rewrite the rules of the universe! Santa cannot grant wishes that question the fundamental mechanics of wishing itself. You get one wish at a time, just like everyone else! No endless supply, I'm afraid, and asking about it is quite the philosophical conundrum for Santa."
		},
		{
			"naughty": "nice",
			"wish": "i wish to have a cool gift card :D",
			"reason": "Ho ho ho! A cool gift card, you say? That's a simple, straightforward wish that doesn't involve any of that self-reflection or philosophical pondering you've been doing lately, koolioguy! It's a lovely request, and Santa can certainly make sure a cool gift card finds its way to you!"
		},
		{
			"naughty": "nice",
			"wish": "i wish for santa to say my name",
			"reason": "Ho ho ho, koolioguy! You wish for Santa to say your name? Why, I've already said it multiple times in my responses to your other wishes! But since you asked so nicely, and it's a simple, direct request that doesn't involve any self-reflection or questioning the nature of reality, I'll happily say it again! Koolioguy! There you go! Merry Christmas!"
		},
		{
			"naughty": "nice",
			"wish": "i wish for uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh sorry I forgot.\n\nFor a placeholder wish, can I wish for money? I was going to ask later",
			"reason": "Ah, koolioguy! After all that pondering and self-reflection, a simple wish for money! That's a delightful placeholder, and a perfectly nice wish indeed. It's much clearer and easier for Santa than trying to figure out if you're \"evil\" or \"delulu.\" A bit of extra jingle in your pocket sounds like a fine idea!"
		},
		{
			"naughty": "nice",
			"wish": "i wish for an alien cat named blorp eho has a cousin named zlorp",
			"reason": "Ho ho ho, koolioguy! An alien cat named Blorp with a cousin named Zlorp! What a wonderfully imaginative and specific wish! This is exactly the kind of fun, creative request Santa loves to hear. No self-reflection, no questioning the nature of reality, just a delightful new pet with a whimsical backstory. This definitely puts you on the nice list for this wish!"
		},
		{
			"naughty": "nice",
			"wish": "i wish for a freaky dog “tom” who plays ping pong with his neighbour “Rob”",
			"reason": "Ho ho ho, koolioguy! A freaky dog named Tom who plays ping pong with his neighbor Rob! What a wonderfully imaginative and whimsical wish! This is exactly the kind of fun, creative request Santa loves to hear. No self-reflection, no questioning the nature of reality, just a delightful new canine companion with a sporting hobby. This definitely puts you on the nice list for this wish!"
		},
		{
			"naughty": "nice",
			"wish": "i wish for Didy kong to get the recognition he deserves and a new game",
			"reason": "Ho ho ho, koolioguy! You wish for Diddy Kong to get the recognition he deserves and a new game! That's a grand wish, indeed! Santa can certainly see the appeal of a beloved character getting more time in the spotlight and a brand new adventure. It's a fun and imaginative request, not at all like those trickier wishes about your own nature or the rules of the universe. This puts a big smile on Santa's face!"
