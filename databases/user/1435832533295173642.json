			"reason": "Oh, koolioguy, you're back again with another wish! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I'm afraid teaching \"rizz\" falls outside of my jolly capabilities. It's not something I can just bestow upon you, and it's also a bit too close to wishing for me to change how you interact with others. That sounds like something you'll have to learn on your own journey, not something for Santa to grant!"
