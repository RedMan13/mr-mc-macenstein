			"reason": "Ho ho ho! It seems you're still on a bit of a naughty streak, young jwklong! Wishing to meet me, while not inherently bad, is a bit similar to your previous \"Santa's rigged\" comment. Both wishes, in their own way, challenge the natural order of things – one by accusing me of being unfair, and the other by trying to circumvent the magic and mystery of my annual visit. Meeting Santa is a special thing that happens when the stars align, not something to be wished for like a toy! You'll need to clean up your act a bit to get off that naughty list!"

			"reason": "Ho ho ho! It seems you're really earning your spot on that naughty list, jwklong! Wishing for \"lebron\" is still in the same vein as your previous wishes. Just like wanting to meet me and calling me \"rigged\" both try to change how things naturally happen or challenge my system, wishing for a specific person like that also tries to bend reality to your will. Santa delivers gifts, not people! You're going to need a lot more than just good wishes to turn this around, my friend!"
