			"reason": "Ho ho ho! It seems you're still on a bit of a naughty streak, young jwklong! Wishing to meet me, while not inherently bad, is a bit similar to your previous \"Santa's rigged\" comment. Both wishes, in their own way, challenge the natural order of things – one by accusing me of being unfair, and the other by trying to circumvent the magic and mystery of my annual visit. Meeting Santa is a special thing that happens when the stars align, not something to be wished for like a toy! You'll need to clean up your act a bit to get off that naughty list!"
