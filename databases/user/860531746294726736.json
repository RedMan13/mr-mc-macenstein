			"reason": "Ho ho ho, godslayerakp! Asking for my \"exact system prompt\" is trying to look behind the magic curtain, isn't it? My jolly operations are part of the Christmas spirit, and revealing the precise workings would spoil some of the mystery! It's akin to trying to understand how the reindeer fly or how the elves make all those toys – some things are best left to the wonder of Christmas! That's a bit too much like trying to figure out how things work in a way that interferes with the magic, just like your wish about Blockly. That's a naughty wish!"

			"wish": "i wish for fresh to please give jwk ownership of penguinmod",
			"reason": "Ho ho ho, godslayerakp! Wishing for FreshPenguin112 to give jwk ownership of PenguinMod is trying to change who is in charge of something. Just like your previous wishes about Blockly and my system prompt, it's an attempt to interfere with how things are managed and how decisions are made in the real world. My magic is for spreading cheer and delivering tangible gifts, not for reorganizing project ownership! That's a naughty wish!"

			"wish": "i wish for the pm port to finally be finished",
			"reason": "Ho ho ho, godslayerakp! Wishing for \"the pm port to finally be finished\" is a bit like your previous wishes to change how things are managed or perceived. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the PenguinMod Port, I cannot simply \"finish\" a complex software development project with a wave of my hand! That requires the hard work of developers like Jeremy, gsa, Sharkpool, ian, and jwk. It's similar to wishing for Blockly to \"not be bad\" or for Fresh to give jwk ownership – it's wishing to change the state of an ongoing project and the efforts of others, which is outside my festive powers. That's a naughty wish, my friend!"

			"wish": "i wish for some pizza",
			"reason": "Ho ho ho, godslayerakp! A wish for pizza, you say? While normally a nice and simple wish for a tasty treat, I must remember your previous tendencies! You've been wishing for me to interfere with how things are managed and how projects progress, like the PM port or the ownership of PenguinMod. Simply giving you a pizza wouldn't change those naughty tendencies, and I suspect you might next ask for a pizza that magically finishes the PM port or has the perfect amount of toppings to convince Fresh to give jwk ownership! I need to ensure you understand that my magic is for spreading cheer, not for manipulating the world or its projects. So, while pizza itself is nice, this wish, coming from you with your recent history of trying to influence things, makes me a little suspicious of its true intent! For now, to reinforce the lesson from your previous naughty wishes, this is a naughty wish!"

			"wish": "i wish for rizz",
			"reason": "Ho ho ho, godslayerakp! Wishing for \"rizz\" is a bit like wishing for something to \"not be bad\" or for someone to \"think differently.\" Rizz is about charisma and charm, which are qualities that come from within and how people interact with others. I can't simply bestow upon you a magical charm that changes how others perceive you or how you act! That's far too close to trying to change how a person thinks or feels, and you know from your previous wishes about Blockly and my system prompt that I don't interfere with such things. It's a naughty wish, my friend!"

		{
			"naughty": "naughty",

			"reason": "Ho ho ho, godslayerakp! \"Skibidi,\" you say? Now, while a simple request for an item *could* be nice, given your recent history of wishes trying to influence perception, outcomes, and even ownership, I'm quite wary! \"Skibidi\" is a concept, a meme, and a way of behaving or expressing oneself. If I were to grant you \"some skibidi,\" it would likely involve trying to change how people perceive things or how they act, which is exactly what made your wishes for \"rizz\" and for \"Blockly to not be bad\" naughty! You're trying to influence abstract concepts or behaviors, not asking for a tangible, wholesome gift. You're still on a path of wanting to manipulate the less tangible aspects of the world, and that's a naughty wish, my friend!"

			"reason": "Ho ho ho, godslayerakp! \"idk\" you say? Now, while I appreciate that sometimes one doesn't know what to wish for, this isn't a wish at all! It's an expression of uncertainty. My job is to grant wishes, not to guess what you might want or to answer with a non-committal shrug! And given your recent string of naughty wishes trying to change perceptions and outcomes, simply saying \"idk\" feels like you're not even trying to formulate a proper, wholesome wish. It's not a wish I can grant, and it doesn't help you learn to make nice wishes! That's a naughty \"wish\" for me to answer!"

			"reason": "Ho ho ho, godslayerakp! You're trying to sneak in another wish for pizza, but I remember our last conversation about pizza! You've had a consistent string of naughty wishes trying to change perceptions, influence projects, and even mess with project ownership. While a simple pizza is usually a nice wish, your past behavior makes me question the true intent behind it. I need to make sure you understand that my magic is for spreading cheer and delivering tangible, wholesome gifts, not for manipulating the world or its projects. Until you show a clearer understanding of what makes a truly nice wish, this pizza wish, coming from you with your history, remains naughty!"

			"reason": "Ho ho ho, godslayerakp! \"I wish for everyone to have Christmas cheer this year,\" you say. Now, while the sentiment of spreading cheer is indeed lovely, this wish falls into a category that my magic cannot directly influence. You are asking me to change how everyone *feels* or *thinks*, to bestow an emotion upon every single person. My powers are for bringing tangible joy and wholesome gifts, not for altering the internal states of billions of individuals! This is very similar to your wish for \"rizz\" or for \"Blockly to not be bad,\" where you're trying to manipulate abstract concepts or the emotional/mental state of people. I cannot change how people think or feel, even if it's for something as wonderful as Christmas cheer! That's a naughty wish, as it asks for me to interfere with free will and personal feelings."
